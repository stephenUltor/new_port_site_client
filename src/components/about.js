                <p className="about-me" data-aos="fade-zoom-in"> I developed a passion for coding and web development in 2021 as I sought to transition
                    from my 7-role as a critical engineering technician to a full-time technical writer. After I wrote all of
                    the documentation and a full training program for a critical Microsoft data center, I was introduced to API documentation and from there to
                    freeCodeCamp.com. I was captivated by all of the new information at my fingertips and I flew through the web
                    development curriculum.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Since then, I have graduated from Scrimba.com in which I learned HTML, CSS,
                    JavaScript, and React as well as developed several projects of my own. I donâ€™t plan to stop learning anytime soon
                    and I'm always looking forward to my next challenge!
